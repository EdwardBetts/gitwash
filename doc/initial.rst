===============
 Initial setup
===============

Before you get going with git_, you'll need to install it, and configure it.

Install
=======

See the git_ page for the most recent information.  

There are good instructions here: http://book.git-scm.com/2_installing_git.html

At the time of writing, these should work for some standard platforms:

================ =============
Debian / ubuntu  ``sudo apt-get install git-core``
Fedora           ``sudo yum install git-core``
Windows          Download and install msysGit_
OS X             Use the git-osx-installer_
================ =============

Configure GIT on each computer
==============================

Configure git_ by identifying yourself, and adding some aliases to
common commands.  We'll use these aliases later.  You only need to do
this once for each computer on which you will use git::
