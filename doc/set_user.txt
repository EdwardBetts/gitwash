This is to tell git_ who you are, for labeling any changes you make to
the code.  The simplest way to do this is from the command line::

  git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
  git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"

This will write the settings into your git configuration file - a file
called ``.gitconfig`` in your home directory.
