.. _forking:

=========================================
Making your own repo copy for development
=========================================

You need to do this only once.  The instructions here are very similar
to the instructions at http://help.github.com/forking/ - please see that
page for more detail.  We're repeating some of it here just to give the
specifics for the |reponame| project, and to suggest some default names.

Set up and configure a github_ account
======================================

If you don't have a github_ account, go to the github_ page, and make one.

You then need to configure your account to allow write access - see the
``Generating SSH keys`` help on `github help`_.

Create your own forked copy of |reponame|
=========================================

#. Log into your github_ account.
#. Go to the |reponame| github home at |repourl|.
#. Click on the *fork* button:

   Now, after a short pause and some 'Hardcore forking action', you
   should find yourself at the home page for your own forked copy of |reponame|.
