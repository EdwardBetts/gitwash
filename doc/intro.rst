 Introduction

This is a small project to describe a git_ / github_ workflow for the
nipy_ project.

There are several different workflows here, for different ways of
working with *nipy*.

This is not a comprehensive git_ reference, it's just a workflow for our
own project.  You may well find better or quicker ways of getting stuff
done with git_, but these should get you started.

There are several excellent general git tutorials:

* `git cheat sheet`_
* `pro git book`_
