 Introduction

This is a small project to describe a git_ workflow for the |reponame| project.

There are two different workflows here, for two different ways of working with |reponame|.

The first way of working we call *latest source user* mode.  You don't yet
think you'll be contributing code, but you want to be able to keep up to
date with the latest version of the source code.

The second is *developer* mode - you think you will probably want to
contribute code or patches to |reponame|.

In fact it turns out that it's fairly easy to switch from a *latest
source user* to a *developer* if you need to.
